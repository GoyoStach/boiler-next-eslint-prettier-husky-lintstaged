The goal of this boilerplate is to have a decent strating point to initiate a NextJS project.
Included :
- Next 14
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Lint-staged

## Getting Started

Installing the nodes packages:

```bash
npm install
```
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Going further

If you are using VScode. I strongly recommend enabling formating on save. 
In `settings.json` add those lines in order to activate it
```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript"]
 }
```
